title: 2016 Review üôèüèø
date: 12/29/2016
summary: 2016 was awesome
---
> **TLDR;** I've had an amazing year of many firsts. Although I had no clearly defined goals for 2016, I've been able to get to a point in my life where it is possible to set practical goals and have the freedom, financial and otherwise, to work towards them.
> This year, I completed my graduate degree at [NYU](http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/management-technology-ms), joined [Andela](https://andela.com), and visited [home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau_State) after 5 years away.

I'd been thinking about doing a year in review for about two years now. However
since I never got my blogging career up-and-started (`\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`) and I always got stuck at the
end of the year with coders block and of course my unwillingness to use any of the easy options out
there (medium, ghost, jekyll, etc) to share my thoughts. 

**NOT** this year though! 

I wrote a static generator with gulp and serve to ensure this year did not pass
without at least one public post. You can find the source code
[here](https://github.com/paulthealien/blog).

So here is 2016 in Review:

## Family üë™üèø

I've been in the US for about 3.8 years now. Since arriving at John F. Kennedy
Airport on March 6th 2013, I haven't been able to make it back home due to a
number of reasons (although those reasons are related to this post, I'll save
you the gory details). 

Needless to say, I'm grateful to have joined a company
that provided the opportunity to go back home as part of a company-sponsored
trip. 

Over these three years in the US, Brooklyn, has been my second home and I've met so
many amazing people I'm glad to call friends.

I was in Nigeria the first two weeks of June. One week was spent at
[Andela's](andela.com) campus in Yaba, Nigeria's largest tech hub. And I got to
travel to Abuja, Nigeria's capital, and then to Jos, Plateau State, my hometown.

The sudden realization that a week was insufficient to really catch up with
family members and friends I had not seen for over 5 years did not dissuade me.
I went all the way to the village where I was born and raised for the first few
years of my life. I met my Grandma, Grandpa, David (my little brother),  and several other family members that oftentimes couldn't recognize me (brings home that old saying *out of sight, out of mind*).

I owe it to myself to always stay in touch with the ones that matter to me and
the ones that have contributed and sacrificed so much to get me to where I am
today.

## Dev & Work üë®‚Äçüíª

I made the decision earlier this year to continue honing my skills as a developer. Before making this decision, I was looking to be a product person. However, where's the fun in being just that???? I want to create. I want to build.

My thinking is, if I want you to build something for me or with me, I want to have
built a few things myself.

And so I navigated the waters a little this year trying to figure out where I want to
focus on developing career-wise. I've been unsuccessful (or successful depending on how you look at it) so I've settled on being a technology
enthusiast until further notice. What this means is, I'll have no long-term
goals for any particular tech stack. 

If it solves my given problem, I'll work
with it, otherwise I'll move on. 

### Dev

I made **726** commits this year. Most of my work was on internal projects and
tools at Andela. This is something I'm looking to improve in 2017. I want to
contribute to OSS and author at least one useful tool. 

<div class="img-container"> 
![Github Contributions 2016][github-contributions-2016]
</div>


### Work

I joined Andela as a Marketing Technology Associate. This is my first full-time
job. Before Andela, I worked part-time jobs within the NYU
entrepreneurial ecosystem. I owe everything I know about startups and business
to my time at NYU. 

Andela has played a huge role in my personal and professional development over
the last year. I've met some of the smartest and most humble individuals in the
world who I'm proud to call friend and co-workers.

I was drawn to the company because of its idealistic yet enlightening view of the
world and where we're headed as a society: 

> Brilliance is evenly distributed but opportunity is not.

I picture [Pangea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea) when I think of what Andela is doing. A world without borders
where individiuals are able to contribute value regardless of where they are.
I'll stop pitching Andela now :).

> Andela is always a mouthful ...so just say **#TIA**

## Other stuff üåÜ üìö üìª üï∫üèø  üéµ
I got around to doing a few other things outside of *work*. I'm a big fan of aligning personal interests with career goals. I don't find that my overarching goals in life are incongruous to my work life and vice-versa. My aim this year was to bring it all together; to align the things I believe in with the work I do everyday. I believe that everything in my life is connected and I'll keep focusing on finding those connections and bridging the gaps between life and work.

This is obviously still a WIP and that will carry onto 2017 and beyond. Please
drop me a line or tweet at me if you've found a way.

### Euro-Trip

I fortunate enough to be able to squeeze some vacation. Albeit impromptu, this
vacation was much needed. 

I traveled from New York to Copenhagen, Denmark by way of Istanbul, Turkey.

In Denmark, I discovered a new found appreciation for the mundane. No NYC, we don't have to be moving at 200mph all the time. Sometimes, the best ideas come from the mundane and many many beautiful things are of the strikingly ordinary and mundane kind.

My friend Magdalena, from NYU, played host while I was in Vienna, Austria. Mag, I'm eternally grateful. She showed me the beautiful countryside of Burgau, she took me to my first spa‚ÄìBad Blumau‚Äìand we spent almost 10 hours there. We hiked up a mountain (didn't summit though üòû ), we visited the beautiful architecture in and around Vienna, and Mag introduced me to the works of Gustav Klimt, Egon Shiele, amongst others.


<div class="img-container">

In Vienna, Austria, this seemingly obvious saying really hit home as I looked upon the strangely architected yet intricately finished Secession Building on whose wall this is inscribed (in Latin of course):

> *To every age its art. To every art its freedom.*

### I don't owe NYU anymore üòÑ

One of my goals when I got accepted into NYU was to finish without any
significant loans. I fell short on this goal by the time I graduated in June.

However, after a few months of out of school, I'm happy to be rid of all my debt to NYU.

### Books ...I love 'em

I picked up on reading this year and got through **10** books (just getting warmed up
for the marathon).

Here are my top **6** of the year:

- [War & Peace](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375760644/)
- [The Pleasure of Finding Things
  Out](https://www.amazon.com/Pleasure-Finding-Things-Out-Richard/dp/0465023959)
- [There was a country](https://www.amazon.com/There-Was-Country-Chinua-Achebe/dp/014312403X)
- [The Old Man and the
  Sea](https://www.amazon.com/Old-Man-Sea-Ernest-Hemingway/dp/0684801221)
- [1984](https://www.amazon.com/1984-George-Orwell/dp/1943138435)

### Podcasts ...I also love 'em

A few podcasts I got hooked on and you should too!

- [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/)
- [Radiolab Presents: More Perfect](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolabmoreperfect/)
- [Philosophize This!](http://philosophizethis.org/)
- [Toolsday](http://www.toolsday.io/)

I cannot recommend Philosophize this enough for anyone looking to get a good
dose of philosophy while commuting especially if you live in NYC. 

### Improv

My first improv class was a team building exercise at Andela's NYC office.

Then at the urging of my friend Isha, I signed up for another session at the Susan Batson Studio. Worth every cent of the $50 I paid. 

Improv, I've learned is not about being funny. I think that was the initial
reason I ran away from it. It's about having fun and making stuff up like when
you were a kid and didn't care so much about what others thought. Improv, like life, is about taking advantage of the here and now.

### Dance

For the record, I still think I'm a not-so-great dancer. I took classes in 2016
but like the gym, I soon fell off track. What I found works is impromptu
classes. And I'm sticking to that in 2017.

Thanks to Tess and other friends that like to get their groove on, I've
gained some confidence on the dancefloor. I want to work on technique and
partner dance routines like salsa, etc.

### Music

A great summary of this year is presented in my Spotify playlist. This
playlist is somewhat revealing of how my mind was all over the place. I
absolutely love it!

I was suppose to pick up the violin this year but failed miserably at even
making the time to tune it.


## Social media

Another great summary for this year is presented by my reaction to posts on
Facebook.

<div class="img-container">

</div>

If by Facebook reactions are to be taken seriously, 2016 wasn't such a bad year
afterall. There is hope.

## Conclusion && 2017 Goals

For many 2016 was a very gloomy year but I've grateful that inspite that seeming gloom, I've made a few steps in the right direction. Yes Brexit was cause for alarm. Yes the Trump presidency isn't something anyone imagined, I'd dare say even for hardcore Trumpers. Where the this road leads, no one knows, not even Trump, but I believe that this was inevitable at some point in the next 10 years. And we will find better ways to understand and accept our differences. Then we can find a middle ground that accommodates every one. 

In my share of civic duty, I attended a few #BlackLivesMatter marches around NYC. I'm looking to contribute to more meaningful causes like this in 2017 until there isn't any need for such movements anymore.

> We shall not rest *Until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream*.

Without getting anymore political, here are my top goals for 2017 in no particular order. I prefer building good
habits over hitting some arbitrary number of something.

- Open source
  
  - Contribute 
  I barely made any contributions to open source this year and I want to steer
  clear of that lonely world. There are plenty open source projects and
  communities out there and I'm looking to be a contributor. My goal to is to hone
  my skills‚Äìcoding, collaboration, and communication‚Äìand to make friends. Two
  communities I'll be looking to contribute to are:
  - ruby
  - javascript 

  - Build something useful
    I've always wanted to build something for myself and 2017 is the chance for me
    to do so. I don't need to make money off it to build it. The only criteria is
    that whatever I build does something useful. Building something cool is for
    the cool kids :). 

- Document and share things I've learned
  
  This simply means I have to start blogging, speaking, or communicating the
  things I learn in a coded manner. This way, I get better and can solicit
  feedback.

- Live healthy

  I quit "going to the gym 6 days a week" in 2016. I learned building healthy
  living habits pay off so much more than trying to a hit a particular number of
  times I go to the gym and feeling guilty when I can't make it there. Living
  healthy is living concious of what I eat, when I eat, and involvement in
  physical activities (dance classes, morning/evening runs).

- Stay spontaneous, be experimental.
  
  Search for new experiences. I want to abstain from planning every minute of
  everyday. I want to live in the here and now and a key to doing that is always
  analyzing the present from what exists in it not from what happened or what
  will happen.
  
  Break shit! I want to explore more ideas through rough prototyping. In this world, perfect
  is what currently is. I toy with ideas that may or may not amount to much.
  This is perfectly acceptable to me. 

- Be confident!
  
  I've always shied away from sharing and defending my views. For a long time,
  I always felt like an imposter especially when I'm around those that
  "appear" to be experts. A key to staying confident I've learnt is letting
  myself fail. It is okay to say the wrong thing and be corrected. It is okay to
  not know. 

Finally, drawing inspiration from Una, I've created a repo to make public my
[goals for 2017](https://github.com/paulthealien/personal-goals) and to track my achievement throughout the year. Although
I've accomplished a few things in 2016, there's so much more room to improve and make impact in 2017.
I'll give myself a proud **C+** in 2016. The Goal for 2017 is to get an **A**.

Welcome 2017! üî• üî• üî•  

P.S this is my first blog post. I'm so looking forward to 2017 üòç.
